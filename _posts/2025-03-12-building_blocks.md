*[FFF]: Fused Filament Fabrication

This is my (humble) take at redesigning the rather ubiquitous construction block.

I had my fair share of playing with these when I was younger. With now upgrade engineering knowledge and new tools I set about creating one that solves the pet peeves I had with the original.

1. Minimal number of unique blocks.
2. Blocks can be 3D printed via FFF in vase mode.
3. Any voxel shape can be assembled, as long as it is connected.

The solution I have come up with is documented at [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/192718-chips-polycube-construction-set).

So while the writeup I have on that site back in 2022 was rather brief and to the point of just letting people play with it. Now I have time to write something more about it.

So actually, to be complete about the voxel shape, you need a fifth piece
