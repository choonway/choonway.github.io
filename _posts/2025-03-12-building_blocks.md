*[FFF]: Fused Filament Fabrication

This is my (humble) take at redesigning the rather ubiquitous construction block.

I had my fair share of playing with these when I was younger. With now upgrade engineering knowledge and new tools I set about creating one that solves the pet peeves I had with the original.

1. Minimal number of unique blocks.
2. Blocks can be 3D printed via FFF in vase mode.
3. Any voxel shape can be assembled, as long as it is connected.

The solution I have come up with is documented at [Printables ChIPs - Polycube Construction Set](https://www.printables.com/model/192718-chips-polycube-construction-set). Variations, as well as FreeCAD files can be obtained [here](https://github.com/choonway/ChIPs)

This was done during the tail end of the COVID-19, so by 2022 I just wanted to get it out there, as there were a couple of urgent jobs that demanded my time and I left it to languish.

Looks like it didn't really pick up, but since now I have made time this and some other unpublished ideas can get some work done on it. :grin:
